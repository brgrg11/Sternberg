# Sternberg (1968) - serial/parallel search of short-term memory
## The experiment: 

In this task, subjects must report whether or not a given target was present in a previous set of items. The set of values varies in length and the target can occur at any position in the set (or not at all). If participants search their memory of the set in a 'serial' fashion then their average response time will increase with increasing set size. If memory can be searched in a 'parallel' fashion then RT will be independent of set size.
